# Rich List App

Developed in Angular Material.

## Instructions

1. Open a shell and change directory to the project folder
2. With *Node.js* installed, run `npm install`
3. Once the packages are installed, run `npm start`
4. Navigate to *localhost:4200* to view the results

## Known issues

+ Filters will only allow use of single selection based on the *Material FormControl* spec
+ Search works and returns results, but it doesn't do anything else... it just searches
+ Never got the time to test in the API for a full stack mock. It is there but just commented out.

## Usage guide

Filters can be used in the top bar. Sort the table by clicking on the header.
